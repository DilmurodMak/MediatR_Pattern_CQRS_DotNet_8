# CQRS Pattern with MediatR in .NET Core

## Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the CQRS pattern and how it is implemented using MediatR in a .NET Core project. The project setup includes `FormulaOne.Api`, `FormulaOne.DataService`, and `FormulaOne.Entities`.

## Key Concepts

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
CQRS is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations for a data store. It uses distinct models for updates (commands) and reads (queries) to optimize performance, scalability, and security.

### MediatR
MediatR is a simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET that facilitates CQRS by decoupling the sender and receiver of requests. It helps in organizing the code by handling commands and queries through handlers.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
DTOs are objects that carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls. They are often used to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another.

## Project Structure

### FormulaOne.Api
- **Controllers**: Define the API endpoints.
- **Driver/Commands**: Contains command definitions for driver-related actions.
- **Driver/Queries**: Contains query definitions for retrieving driver data.
- **Handlers**: Implementations of command and query handlers.
- **DriverAchievements**: Follows the same pattern as Driver for achievements.

### FormulaOne.DataService
- **Data/AppDBContext**: Database context for Entity Framework Core.
- **Repositories**: 
  - **UnitOfWork**: Coordinates the work of multiple repositories.
  - **GenericRepository**: Provides generic CRUD operations.
  - **AchievementsRepository**: Specific repository for achievements.
  - **DriverRepository**: Specific repository for drivers.

### FormulaOne.Entities
- **DbSet**: 
  - **Achievement**: Represents the achievement entity.
  - **BaseEntity**: Base class for entities.
  - **Driver**: Represents the driver entity.
- **Dtos**: Contains DTOs for requests and responses.
